betkey, fallen project

This is the code of the project I was working on for two months, and it failed because of the absence of financing. I used apache, php5, mongoDB, js and bootstrap.

PATH parser - parser get json another site -> sorting massive -> include mongoDB.

PATH public_html - backend and frontend site.
