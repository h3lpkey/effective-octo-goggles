Hi there!  
This is my **very first serious web project**, made over **10 years ago**. Back then, I was just getting into web development, and this felt like a **masterpiece of engineering brilliance**  
(spoiler: it wasn’t).

I’m keeping this project here not because it’s useful or impressive — but because:

- ✨ It’s a **reminder** of how far I’ve come.
- 😄 It’s something I open every few years just to **laugh and cringe** at the code.
- 🛠 It’s a **time capsule** of who I was as a developer starting out.
- 🔁 It’s an **anchor**, a quiet monument to my journey.

If you somehow ended up here and decide to run the code — may the browser gods be with you.  
Expect things like inline styles, mysterious variables like `x`, jQuery wizardry, and lots of spaghetti.

## Why does this even exist?

If you're just starting out: let this be a friendly reminder that it’s okay to write **messy, weird code**.  
We all start somewhere. The important thing is to **keep going**.

If you're already experienced: maybe you’ve got a dusty old repo too — and maybe that repo still matters, in its own way.

## P.S.

I’m not going to rewrite or “improve” this.  
This isn’t a project to fix — it’s a project to **remember**.  
Like an old photo, or a strange little drawing in a childhood notebook.

It’s not about the result — it’s about the **beginning**.
